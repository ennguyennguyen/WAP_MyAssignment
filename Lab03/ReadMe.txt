I have done all the exercises and most of the time I had to look at the solution. The issue of CSS is: there are so much thing to understand. For each configuration, there are many smaller items, e.g: we need to understand what overflow will do, and within Overflow, there are visible, hidden, scroll, auto, etc. The same for other configuration.

I know in order to understand CSS thorougly, there is no other option than practice it, a lot. Way more than I practice coding Java or Python.
